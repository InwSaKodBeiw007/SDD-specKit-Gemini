# Webboard-SDD Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality
All code MUST be clean, maintainable, and well-documented. This includes adhering to a consistent coding style, using meaningful variable names, and writing clear comments for complex logic.

### II. Testing Standards
Every feature MUST be accompanied by a comprehensive suite of tests, including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests. Test-Driven Development (TDD) is strongly encouraged. All tests MUST pass before a feature is considered complete.

### III. User Experience Consistency
The user experience MUST be consistent and intuitive across the entire application. This includes using a consistent design system, clear and concise language, and predictable user flows.

### IV. Performance Requirements
The application MUST meet defined performance standards. This includes fast load times, responsive UI, and efficient resource usage. Performance testing MUST be a part of the development process.

## Governance
All pull requests and code reviews must verify compliance with this constitution. Any deviation from these principles must be explicitly justified and approved.
