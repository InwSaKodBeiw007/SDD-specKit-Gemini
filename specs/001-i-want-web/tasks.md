# Tasks: Display Pad Thai Food Card

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-i-want-web/`

## Phase 3.1: Setup
- [X] T001 Create the basic file structure: `src/index.html`, `src/style.css`, `src/script.js`, and `src/images/`.
- [X] T002 Add the provided `Padd-Thai-HD.jpg` image to the `src/images/` directory.

## Phase 3.2: Core Implementation
- [X] T003 In `src/index.html`, create the HTML structure for the main container, the food card, and the recommendations section. Include placeholder elements for the image, title, description, spiciness level, and recommendations.
- [X] T004 In `src/style.css`, add CSS to style the page. Center the card, style the text and image, and set up the desktop layout with the recommendations section next to the card.
- [X] T005 In `src/style.css`, add responsive design rules (media queries) to ensure the recommendations section stacks below the card on mobile devices.
- [X] T006 In `src/script.js`, create a JavaScript object to hold the data for the Pad Thai card (name, description, imageUrl, spicinessLevel).
- [X] T007 In `src/script.js`, write code to dynamically populate the HTML elements with the data from the JavaScript object when the page loads.

## Phase 3.3: Polish
- [X] T008 [P] Review and format the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to ensure they meet the code quality standards defined in the constitution.
- [X] T009 [P] Add comments to the CSS and JavaScript files to explain complex sections.

## Phase 3.4: Validation
- [X] T010 Manually test the application by following all scenarios in `specs/001-i-want-web/quickstart.md`. Verify that all expected results are met.
