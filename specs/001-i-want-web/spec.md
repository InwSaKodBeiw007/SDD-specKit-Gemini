## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to view a web page that prominently displays a card with information about Pad Thai, so that I can quickly see details and recommendations about the dish.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user navigates to the web page, **When** the page loads, **Then** a card featuring "Pad Thai" is displayed in the center.
2. **Given** the Pad Thai card is visible, **When** the user looks at the content, **Then** they see an image of Pad Thai, its name, a short description, and a spiciness level of 5/10.
3. **Given** the Pad Thai card is visible, **When** the user looks next to the card, **Then** they see a section with placeholder recommendations.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if the image for Pad Thai is missing? The system should show a placeholder image.
- How does the layout respond on a mobile device? The recommendation section should stack below the card.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST display a single, static web page.
- **FR-002**: The page MUST feature a central card element dedicated to a food item.
- **FR-003**: The food item displayed MUST be "Pad Thai".
- **FR-004**: The card MUST contain an image, the name "Pad Thai", and the description "use noodle and Serve with chopsticks".
- **FR-005**: A section with placeholder recommendation text MUST be displayed adjacent to the food card on desktop views.
- **FR-006**: The content MUST be presented on a single screen without the need for scrolling on a standard desktop view.
- **FR-007**: The card MUST display a spiciness level of "5/10".

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
