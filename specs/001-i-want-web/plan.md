# Implementation Plan: Display Pad Thai Food Card

**Branch**: `001-i-want-web` | **Date**: 2025-10-01 | **Spec**: [link to spec.md]

## Summary
This plan outlines the implementation of a single-page website to display a "Pad Thai" food card. The page will be built with basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring a central card with an image, a specific description, a spiciness level of 5/10, and an adjacent recommendations section. The implementation will adhere to the project constitution, focusing on quality, UX consistency, and performance.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: HTML5, CSS3, ES6 JavaScript
**Primary Dependencies**: None
**Storage**: N/A (No database)
**Testing**: Manual testing based on `quickstart.md` scenarios.
**Target Platform**: Modern Web Browsers
**Project Type**: Single project
**Performance Goals**: Page loads in under 2 seconds on a standard connection.
**Constraints**: Must use a user-provided image named `Padd-Thai-HD.jpg`. No backend or database is required.
**Scale/Scope**: A single, static web page.

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **I. Code Quality**: Code will be formatted, commented, and organized for clarity.
- **II. Testing Standards**: Testing will be manual for this simple static site. A `quickstart.md` will define testing scenarios based on the clarified acceptance criteria.
- **III. User Experience Consistency**: The design will be clean, simple, and responsive, ensuring a consistent experience on desktop and mobile.
- **IV. Performance Requirements**: The page will be optimized for fast loading by using efficient code and optimized images.

**Structure Decision**: A simple, single-project structure is chosen for this static website, containing all necessary files in the `src` directory.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
No research is required as the technology stack is simple and has been explicitly defined.

**Output**: `research.md` (will be created but remain empty).

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1.  **Data Model**: Define the structure for the food item in `data-model.md` based on the clarified spec.
2.  **API Contracts**: Not applicable for this static site.
3.  **Test Scenarios**: Define manual testing steps in `quickstart.md` based on the clarified spec.
4.  **Agent File Update**: The agent context will be updated with the tech stack.

**Output**: `data-model.md`, `quickstart.md`.
